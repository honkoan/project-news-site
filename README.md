# News Site

A responsive newspaper site with header, big news section and other news section. 

## Learning goals

How to
* use boxmodel to structure webpages
* use flexbox to layout webpages
* create responsive webpages for mobile, desktop and tablet

First I planned the site on paper and then I coded site's basic structure and styled it. I used flexbox and media queries. If I had more time I would have tried CSS grid.
